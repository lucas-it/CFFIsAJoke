# CFFIsAJoke
![Deploy master branch](https://github.com/lucas-it/CFFIsAJoke/workflows/Deploy%20master%20branch/badge.svg?branch=master)

A bot that daily post informations about SBB/CFF/FFS disruptions.
The bot is talking on [@cffisajoke](https://twitter.com/cffisajoke)

## The original idea
I was inspired by the french youtuber [Micode](https://youtube.com/channel/UCYnvxJ-PKiGXo_tYXpWAC-w). He created a twitter bot to find out how many trains are late and to calcul the cumulated delay. But the bot is talking about SNCF (French rails company) so I created a Swiss version.
